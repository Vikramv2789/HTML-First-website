    <p> One of my favorite football players is Tom Brady. Tom Brady won 7
        super bowls in total. One for the buccaneers and six for the patriots.
        He is one of the greatest people to ever play the game of football.
        He is a team player.

        One of my least favorite things to do is play basketball. People think that just because I am tall, it means that I am automatically destined to play the sport.
        I can't play the sport at all. No offense to people who play basketball, but I now hate basketball. It is one of my least favorite things to do.
